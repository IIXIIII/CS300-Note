================================

ArrayList - oversized array
  compact - no gap

for array addition:
  add at the front, but first shift all the element in the arraylist backward. 

Linked List:
  add at any location


primitive   and   reference type variable
heap              steak
diff region       which is a memory region 
shared            have a phrame that is unique to each method

NullPointerException:

Memory Regions:
Code                                                                 (the space is constant)
Static Memory: any static (class) variables                          (the space is constant)
Stack: local variables - primitive values and referencess to objects (the space is growing down from top) 
                                                                  
Heap: object memory, what get used when you say New                  (the space is growing up from bottom)
