  array and methods
===================================


int numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,6};

overesized array: have a size value 
perfect size array: no other value, the length is the size

null - the reference is empty, pointing to nothing in the mamory

primitive type: int, double, char, flow, ... 
  don't have a reference on the memory, because it is small enough
Object: have a pointer that point to the memory

Methods (not functions)
          because methods in java is associated with a class, and all code in java live inside a calss

Static method is for this class
  when creating our own Object in another calss, then the static is not used

example:
//defingn the method 
public static String methodName (int p){ //p for parameters 
  //what the method do
  //using the generic input p 
}
//calling the method 
String s1 = methodName(5);
String s2 = methodName(10);
//etc
